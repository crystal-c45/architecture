When hanging the TV, it can't fit snugly against the wall because of the bracket. The departure is small, but the designers decided that even this space can be used wisely. And they found a simple but elegant solution: they turned the pivoting panel into a cabinet door. Combined with a nightstand, the element forms a stylish and functional set for the living room. The cabinet turned out narrow, however, and not wide shelves are always useful for placing some things.

## Bench-table

Usually, transformer furniture is created for enclosed spaces because of the limited space of apartments. The garden area is more spacious, but still, why put two pieces of furniture when you can get by with one that replaces both, like a bench-table? It looks elegant, and it is comfortable to sit on in the evening, reclining on the back. And if necessary, with one movement the bench turns into a table and two benches that can comfortably seat six adults. A convenient and practical solution that creates comfort without cluttering the space.

Interesting fact: This bench-table model was designed by an English craftsman and presented it online in late 2018. He makes no secret of his design and sells the making instructions for $25. Using these blueprints, a home craftsman who knows how to work with tools will be able to make a transformer bench himself.
